## About Me
With extensive experience in Salesforce administration, I collaborate with cross-functional teams to collect and evaluate business requirements, translating them into effective Salesforce technical solutions. My expertise includes user management, profiles, roles, role hierarchy, permission sets, and data security configurations. I manage Salesforce components such as reports, dashboards, workflows, dynamic flows, approval processes, and Lightning pages.

I specialize in Salesforce CPQ, handling product bundling, pricing, discounting, and approval workflows. I ensure the accurate setup and maintenance of price books, product catalogs, pricing rules, and discount schedules, and I excel in automating processes to improve business outcomes.

In addition to managing Salesforce releases using a structured release management approach, I facilitate seamless integration with other systems and manage changes using change sets and deployment tools. My work extends to developing Lightning web components, Visualforce pages, Apex triggers, and providing code reviews.

I have hands-on experience in testing methodologies such as functional, integration, smoke, unit, and UAT testing, ensuring smooth deployments. I also manage data exports and imports using Data Loader and Data Import Wizard and regularly perform data audits to ensure data integrity.

I am committed to staying updated with Salesforce's latest features and best practices by attending events and completing Trailhead modules. I provide user training, support, and detailed documentation, handling end-user tickets and addressing functionality questions.

Certified as a Salesforce Administrator (ADM 201), Salesforce Certified Associate, and Salesforce CPQ Specialist, I bring strong technical expertise, combined with interpersonal and management skills. I am also proficient in Agile/Scrum methodologies and testing tools like Jira, Q-test, and Test Rail.
